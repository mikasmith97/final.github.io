## About the Collection

In 2019, I lived in Australia and took two big trips: one a road trip along the western coast of Australia and one a country hopping trip through Asia. This collection contains some of my favorite images of the animals, nature, and human-made objects I saw along the way. I am the creator of all these images. 

I made this digital library as a final project for LS 575. However, while it serves as my final project, the audience I have in mind for the library is friends and family who have been wanting easy access to objects and information from the trips. 

Enjoy, 
Mika
